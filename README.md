# Pomodoro Clock
A classic pomodoro clock aimed towards helping improve productivity.
The idea behind a pomodoro session is to have three consecutive work sessions of 25 min with two breaks of 5 min in between. 
This app allows for adjustable work and break sessions and includes multiple color themes.
